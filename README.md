# Parkers-Drive-In

## User Story

AS A viewer that is a cinema enthusiast.
I WANT to provide an appealing, user friendly interface, that provides information about movies on streaming services.
SO THAT the embarrassment of scrolling for hours on end; unable to find entertainment and ultimately being told to pass the remote can be avoided.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I input a genre, enter a keyword, and select the streaming services I currently have.
WHEN I click the Search Button
THEN I am shown a list of movies that follow under my selected input.  
GIVEN I find my desired movie.
WHEN I click "More Info".
THEN a Expanded modal pops up; With a short description of the movie, year released, Title, and rating of the movie.
GIVEN I am done reading the information.
WHEN i click "Close" 
THEN it closes out the modal and returns to the movie list. 

## Description

Improve the user experience by implementing parameters to pinpoint more accurate information regarding options for “Streaming Platforms”.
As well as providing a user friendly Interface, that is simple, straight to the point, and ultimately provides great information regarding desired movies.
Gives compelling information such as a Short Description, Title, Runtime, IMDb Ratings, year released, as well as a Image Poster of the movie and Youtube Link.
